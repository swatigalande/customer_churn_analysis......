● Objective: The analysis primarily investigates factors influencing customer churn,
particularly focusing on payment methods and contract types.

long-term contracts may improve customer retention.
○ Payment Methods: A significant proportion of customers using electronic checks
are more likely to churn compared to those using other payment methods (credit
cards, bank transfers, etc.). This could be due to convenience or trust issues
associated with electronic check payments.
● Churn Rate by Tenure:
○ Customers with shorter tenure (less than one year) are more likely to churn,
indicating the criticality of initial engagement strategies.
● Visualizations:
○ The visualizations, including bar plots and line graphs, highlight the disparity in
churn rates by different contract types and payment methods. They also show
trends over customer tenure, supporting the need for personalized retention
strategies.

Executive Summary:
Objective:
The analysis explores customer churn patterns, focusing on various factors such as payment
methods, contract types, tenure, and demographic attributes. The goal is to identify which
factors are most strongly associated with higher churn rates to guide customer retention
strategies.
Key Insights & Findings:
● Contract Type and Churn:
○ Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn rate, with
42% of such customers likely to churn.
○ In contrast, customers on one-year and two-year contracts have churn rates of
11% and 3%, respectively.
○ Implication: Longer contract periods serve as a strong retention tool, as
customers with extended commitments are far less likely to leave.
● Payment Methods and Churn:
○ Customers paying via electronic checks show the highest churn rate at 45%,
while those using credit cards, bank transfers, or mailed checks have
significantly lower churn rates, averaging around 15-18%.
○ Implication: The convenience, security, and trust issues related to electronic
payments might be contributing factors. Encouraging customers to switch to
more stable payment methods could reduce churn.
● Churn by Tenure:
○ Customers with less than one year of tenure are the most likely to churn, with a
50% churn rate. Those with 1-3 years of tenure show a decreasing churn trend
at 35%, while customers who have been with the company for more than three
years have a churn rate of just 15%.
○ Implication: Engaging customers early in their journey, especially within the first
year, is critical for retention.
● Churn by Internet Service Type:
○ Customers using Fiber Optic services show a higher churn rate of 30%,
compared to DSL customers with a churn rate of 20%.
○ Implication: This could be due to increased competition or dissatisfaction with
service quality. Understanding customer satisfaction with service speed and
reliability may help retain fiber optic users.
● Senior Citizens and Churn:
○ The analysis reveals that senior citizens (aged 65+) have a churn rate of 41%,
compared to a 26% churn rate among non-senior citizens.
○ Implication: Special retention programs and targeted customer service for senior
customers may help reduce churn in this demographic.
Visualizations & Data Insights:
● Bar Charts and Line Graphs:
○ The visual representation of churn by payment method clearly shows that
customers using electronic checks churn almost three times as much as those
using more traditional or secure methods like credit cards.
○ Customer tenure vs. churn rate visualizations reveal a clear declining trend in
churn as customers' tenure increases, underscoring the need for early-stage
customer loyalty programs.
● Percentage Distribution of Churn Across Factors:
○ Payment Methods: 45% churn for electronic check users, 15% for credit card
users.
○ Contract Types: 42% churn for month-to-month contracts, 11% for yearly
contracts, 3% for two-year contracts.
○ Tenure: 50% churn in the first year, dropping to 15% after three years.
Recommendations:
● Promote Long-Term Contracts: Offer incentives for customers to commit to longer
contracts to reduce churn.
● Address Payment Method Concerns: Implement campaigns encouraging customers
to switch from electronic checks to more reliable payment methods.
● Customer Engagement in Early Tenure: Focus on improving the customer experience
within the first year, as churn is highest in this period.
● Special Senior Citizen Retention Programs: Create personalized offers or assistance programs to retain the senior demographic
